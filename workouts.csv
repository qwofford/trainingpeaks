"Lap Swimming","Swim","","","","2020-06-10","","825","","",""," *06/10/2020 Quincy Wofford: Some thoughts about my swimming: 1.) I struggle to swim more than 100m before I need to take a breather. I do try to swim at an endurance pace, with very little leg activity. 2.) I have practiced breathing from left and right sides, and i don't seem to struggle with that. I tend to take a breath every 3rd stroke until I get tired, then I just breath on the right side after every right stroke. 3.) 800 meters non-stop in open water seems like a difficult prospect to me at this stage. I wonder if I could do it at any pace.* *06/15/2020 Geoffrey Chandler: Bilateral breathing sure evens out  your stroke but it's common to feel like you're running out of air. I was never able to do it more than 200 or 300 yards. Something else to try is breathing 2 times one side then two times the other side. A way to do bilateral breathing but getting more oxygen.*","0.356170278125339","0.63953488372093","","19","","","","","","0.534775063449582","5.45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maybe I spoke too soon yesterday. Going forward, please feel free to schedule swims on days with other exercises scheduled. I enjoyed getting up early to swim, then doing a ""main exercise"" later in the day. If that's reasonable from a training perspective, I'd like to continue stacking swimming with something else.

You want your glutes and quads activated on the way down, and your hamstring and hip flexors activated on the way up. -- Visualize scraping mud off the bottom of your shoe as you pull across the bottom of the stroke. -- To properly engage your hamstrings think about trying to pulling your heel up to your butt when your crank arm is going from 6 o’clock to 10 o’clock. -- Your knees should be tracking straight up and down, no collapsing in or out! -- Your core should be fully engaged to keep your hips rock steady in the saddle. This will be easier if you are both pushing and pulling during each pedal revolution.","7020.18994140625","108","203","163.64","","0.42058053612709","4.63700008392334","","53","","127","146","","","0.628061498596605","16.26","1","21","3","0","0","","","","","","13","9","2","1","0","0","","","","","",""
